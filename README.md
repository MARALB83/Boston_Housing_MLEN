# Boston_Housing_MLEN
Supervised learning regression project done as part of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity.

# Disclaimer

This project was done as part of Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. It started as a template developed by Udacity which I completed with code of my own in order to uncover insights in the data and to answer the questions.

# Data dependencies:

## housing.csv

The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

**Features**
1.  `RM`: average number of rooms per dwelling
2. `LSTAT`: percentage of population considered lower status
3. `PTRATIO`: pupil-teacher ratio by town

**Target Variable**
4. `MEDV`: median value of owner-occupied homes

# Other dependencies:

Python 3 version was used to run the Notebook.

## visuals.py

This is a Python module that was made available by Udacity. It provides visualizations that help see the performance of a decision tree regressor on both the training and the testing datasets, across multiple 'max_depth' parameter.
